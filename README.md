## 📌 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks and code in this repository, you should have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Common Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

> You may also use a virtual environment (venv/conda) to isolate dependencies.

### Running a Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/se-farooqahmad/AI-ML.git
   cd AI-ML
   ```

2. Start Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to any assignment folder and open the `.ipynb` file to run the code interactively.

## 📌 Dataset Details

All datasets used across the assignments are placed under the `Dataset/` directory.
Descriptions for individual datasets (including source and schema) may be included within the respective assignment folders or dataset subfolders.
